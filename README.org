#+TITLE:         Unmanaged Concurrent Hash Tries

Concurrent hash tries are fast, lock free, wait free, thread safe
data structures with constant time snapshots. The C++ implementation
contained here is translated from Aleksandar Prokopec's Scala
implementation at https://github.com/axel22/Ctries.

The translated code makes no attempt to destroy defunct objects. This
is to say that the example code contained in test-ctrie.cpp leaks
memory.
